Text extraction from images and real-time camera using EasyOCR
# Text Extraction from Images using Pattern Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a **text extraction (OCR) system** using **EasyOCR** to recognize text from both **static images** and **real-time camera input**. The system is designed to demonstrate practical OCR workflows along with basic performance evaluation and visualization.

This project is developed as a **final-year major project**.

## Evaluation Method
- OCR is performed on all images in the dataset.
- Ground truth is manually created for **50 selected images**.
- Accuracy is calculated by comparing OCR output with ground truth.
- Performance is analyzed using visual plots and annotated images.

## How to Run
1. Activate Conda environment:
   ```bash
     conda activate base
